# Notes

## Fort
Word fort is loosely defined fort since it does not always mean fortification (defence wall or structure).  Castles and fortified building can very well fit the description just that they may not be called as forts.

### Type of forts
* Hill forts/Castles: may or may not have walls built
* Land forts/Castles: fortification is common, but no significant elevation.  Sometimes walled cities will be covered under this
* Water forts:  Forts in sea, river, lake
